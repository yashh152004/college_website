                <h2>A NEW DIMENSION IN THE FIELD OF COMPUTER SCIENCE</h2>
                <p>THE GOAL OF COMPUTER ENGINEERING IS TO DEVELOP THE EFFICIENT AND RELIABLE USE OF COMPUTERS AND COMPLEX HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE SYSTEMS THAT PROVIDE SOLUTIONS FOR REAL-WORLD PROBLEMS THIS INVOLVES EVERYTHING, FROM THE DESIGN TO THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AND FROM HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE INTEGRATION TO TESTING AND EVALUATION. THE FIELD OF COMPUTER ENGINEERING REQUIRES A FOUNDATION OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING BASICS. COMPUTER ENGINEERING IS OFTEN DEFINED AS THE DISCIPLINE OF EMBEDDED SYSTEMS.</p>
                <p>COMPUTER SCIENCE IS THE STUDY OF COMPUTERS AND COMPUTATIONAL SYSTEMS AND THE USE OF SOFTWARE ALGORITHMS TO HELP SOLVE COMPLEX COMPUTING PROBLEMS.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>HARDWARE COMPUTER ENGINEERS DESIGN AND DEVELOP COMPUTER SYSTEMS, CIRCUIT BOARDS, COMPUTER CHIPS, AND RELATED EQUIPMENT.</li>
                    <li>SOFTWARE COMPUTER ENGINEERS CREATE THESE TOOLS THAT ARE ABLE TO MANAGE THE OPERATIONS AND DESIGN OF COMPUTERS BY MANAGING SOFTWARE, SYSTEMS, AND NETWORKS AS WELL AS BY WRITING CODE.</li>
